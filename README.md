# fritzing-parts

This repository contains Fritzing parts that are needed to follow the examples on https://roboter-basteln.de/.

These parts might not integrate with other parts very well, e.g. I have noticed that the top view capacitor may change to a side view capacitor, because it somehow merges with existing capacitors. Also, I don't know how to make the capacitance changeable.
